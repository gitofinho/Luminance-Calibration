## Luminance Calibration Automatic
Intern Project at Lishan Tech in Guro-gu, Seoul.
Period: '21.06 ~ '21.09 (3M)

#Project Overview
This project automates the calibration process by estimating the luminance value of captured images using singular value decomposition (SVD) of the camera's luminance values. It is being introduced in tunnels in South Korea with the aim of reducing accident rates.
